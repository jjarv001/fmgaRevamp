# Mushrooms

Our top priority is producing mushrooms. Our mushrooms are sold both fresh and as secondary products. 
We currently have approximately 10,000 logs inoculated with different varieties, and are always trying 
to expand our operation.

# Secondary Products

While our main goal is to produce mushrooms, there are many forms that mushroom products can take. Tinctures, teas, seasonings, and freeze-dried products are just a few of our offerings.

# Top Quality

Many mushrooms you'll find elsewhere are grown in climate-controlled facilities with minimal exposure 
to the natural environment. The vast majority of our product develops where its designed to: nature. On 
top of being much more sustainable and environmentally friendly, our produce has flavor complexities 
that you won't find your typical store-bought mushrooms.

## Front-end Development

The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.

> As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

## Design Systems

A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized to aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites.

## Process

There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page.

- User experience research
- Visual design and illustration
- Programming and coding

Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.
