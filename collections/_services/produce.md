# Spore to Supper

Mushrooms can be grown in many ways, and we strive to perfect the sustainable methods.

In nature, mushrooms grow on forest floors, logs, and a variety of other mediums. Modern growing methods 
often involve plastic grow bags, controlled environments, and/or the use of chemicals.

The bulk of our produce is grown on logs using modern techniques, providing a more sustainable and
natural production method.

## How's it done?

Lots of planning. Our current produce is years in the making. We spend a considerable amount of time 
in the spring and fall felling trees and inoculating. We often don't start seeing produce until a year or two after inoculation.

While our time put in up-front is substantial, the result is little overhead in terms of expenses. Because most of product is log-grown, we let the woods do the climate control. When Mother Nature decides, its harvest time.

The low overhead lets us keep our prices in-line if not better than the big names.

## Front-end Development

The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.

> As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

## Design Systems

A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized to aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites.

## Process

There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page.

- User experience research
- Visual design and illustration
- Programming and coding

Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.
