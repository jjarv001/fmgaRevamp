# We're a co-op

We came together from all walks to form a co-op dedicated to sustainable mushroom cultivation practices. 
We're tight-knit when it comes to business, but we're also all within a short driving distance. That means we can back each other up when needed.

## What's a co-op?

"Co-op" is short for cooperative. Generally speaking, it means an organization where there's no sole proprieter. It's a group of individuals, or individual businesses, coming together to take part in an overarching goal. In our case, this is mushroom cultivation, processing, and sales.

## How does this benefit the consumer?

This benefits the consumer in multiple ways.

Because all our members are interested in staying in business, there's a form of "checks and balances" when it comes to quality and standards. We all expect top quality product. If one of us falls short, we all fall short. In other words, it's in a co-ops nature for individual members to hold each other accountable.

When it comes to delivery, we'll make it happen. Since it's a co-op, we're all invested. If someone's out of town or sick, there's always someone there to pick up the slack.

Finally, communication. What we lack in screen-time we make up for in numbers. There will always be someone who responds to an email, text, or phone call (just don't call Pat).

## How does this benefit us?

The beautiful thing about a co-op is the cooperation.

We're there to back each other up, whether it be at harvest time or at a farmer's market. We work together on joint production operations, supply each other when one farmer has a shortage and another excess, and we're there to check on each other's crops when someone's out of town or sick.

All of the aforementioned benefits are key to our success, but one of our greatest assets as a co-op is shared knowledge. We share with each other new techniques, observations, and methods. We share ideas, perspectives, and innovations. Shared knowledge is key to our success, both in cultivation and business.

## Interested in joining?

We grow mushrooms, but we're also looking to grow our co-op. [Contact us](/contact) if you think you might be interested (serious growers only).
