# We're a co-op

We came together from all walks to form a co-op dedicated to sustainable mushroom cultivation practices. 
We're tight-knit when it comes to business, but we're also all within a short driving distance. That means we can back each other up when needed.

## What's a co-op?

"Co-op" is short for cooperative. Generally speaking, it means an organization where there's no sole proprieter. It's a group of individuals, or individual businesses, coming together to take part in an overarching goal. In our case, this is mushroom cultivation, processing, and sales.

## How does this benefit the consumer?

This benefits the consumer in multiple ways.

Because all our members are interested in staying in business, there's a form of "checks and balances" when it comes to quality and standards. We all expect top quality product. If one of us falls short, we all fall short. In other words, it's in a co-ops nature for individual members to hold each other accountable.

When it comes to delivery, we'll make it happen. Since it's a co-op, we're all invested. If someone's out of town or sick, there's always someone there to pick up the slack.

Finally, communication. What we lack in screen-time we make up for in numbers. There will always be someone who responds to an email, text, or phone call (just don't call Pat).

## Front-end Development

The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.

> As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

## Design Systems

A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized to aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites.

## Process

There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page.

- User experience research
- Visual design and illustration
- Programming and coding

Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.
