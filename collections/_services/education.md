# Current Courses

We currently offer one course, and it's designed to introduce potential growers to the world of mushroom-cultivation. This course covers a lot in a short period. Some of the topics include:

  - Cultivation methods
  - Popular strains
  - Medicinal applications
  - Environmental applications
  - Land Stewardship/Planning
  - Hands-on experience

This is a condensed course. It wont't teach you everything, but it is a great starting point for individuals looking to expand their knowledge on mushrooms and fungi in general. You'll spend a fair amount of time in a classroom setting, as well as some time outdoors (weather permitting) inoculating logs.

# Future Courses

We have several courses planned for the future, they're just not complete yet.

## Mushrooms in the Kitchen

One of our founding members, Christian, is a former chef. His culinary expertise brings a tasteful dynamic to products, and we intend to host courses that will show and teach the versatility of mushrooms in the kitchen. Mushrooms are often considered a delicacy, so why not learn how to make your own delicious art?

## Cultivation

Our current course covers a large amount of information in a short period of time. This leaves room to improve on details. 

One of the main things people come to us in search of is knowledge on how to grow, what to grow, and when to harvest. Our in-depth cultivation course will focus solely on cultivation techniques, stacking, ideal strains for our area, and harvesting.

This course is will be designed for people who are familiar with fungi and mushrooms, but interested in learning more about the intricasies of our operations. This course will include:

  - Cultivation techniques (in-depth, hands-on)
  - Experimental techniques
  - Insight into yields
  - Insight into strain/tree-species matching
  - Market potential
  - Intro to Stewardship
  - Combined views from our individual growers

We don't claim to know everything about growing mushrooms, but our combined knowledge and experience goes a good distance. We share what we learn individually within our group, so when there's a new development for one of us it's a new development for all of us. This knowledge, once tried and true, will become part of this course.


<!-- ## What is Web Design?

User experience is about how a user interacts with, and experiences, a particular product, system or service. As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

<!-- ## Front-end Development

The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.

> As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

## Design Systems

A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized to aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites.

## Process

There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page.

- User experience research
- Visual design and illustration
- Programming and coding -->

Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another. -->
