## Chesapeake Bay Croquet Club

This is our main project. The [Chesapeake Bay Croquet Club](https://cbcc.fun/) is one of the largest, if not the largest, croquet clubs in the world. As it so happens, there's also a lot of timber and land management that's necessary for the property.

Thanks to the open-mindedness and entreprenuership of the owner, our organization is working with this amazing location to help manage their woodlands and produce a crop worth selling. We get to fell, inoculate, and harvest on-site. The owner takes a portion of the profits with minimal labor, and gets low-cost land management for that portion of their property. It's a win-win.

If you're interested in mushrooms, please reach out and [contact us](/contact), or if you're interested in croquet please check out the [Chesapeake Bay Croquet Club](https://cbcc.fun/).

<!-- 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## History

John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format". Its key design goal is readability. That the language be readable as-is.

> Designing affordable units within the existing water works area required an extensive site survey and ground testing.

To this end, its main inspiration is the existing conventions for marking up plain text in email, though it also draws from earlier markup languages, notably setext, Textile, and reStructuredText.

## Example

There are several different versions of markdown

### CommonMark

From 2012, a group of people including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane launched what Atwood characterized as a standardization effort. A community website now aims to "document various tools and resources available to document authors and developers, as well as implementors of the various markdown implementations".

### GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)

In 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of their GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark. It follows the CommonMark specification exactly except for tables, strikethrough, autolinks and task lists, which the GitHub spec has added as extensions. GitHub also changed the parser used on their sites accordingly, which required that some documents be changed. For instance, GFM now requires that the hash symbol that creates a heading be separated from the heading text by a space character.he user to create their own.

### Markdown Extra

Markdown Extra is a lightweight markup language based on Markdown implemented in PHP (originally), Python and Ruby. It adds features not available with plain Markdown syntax. Markdown Extra is supported in some content management systems such as, for example, Drupal.

Markdown Extra adds the following features to Markdown:

- markdown markup inside HTML blocks
- elements with id/class attribute
- "fenced code blocks" that span multiple lines of code
- tables
- definition lists
- footnotes
- abbreviations -->
